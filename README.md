# show-me-songs

## Description

In todays world many APIs exist. Our team wanted to take two APIs and merge them to create a functional application taht would allow users to search song lyrics through the ChartLyrics API to then generate a YouTube playlist. The idea was to better utilize these exisitng APIs to create a more condensed playlist that is truly specific to what the user wants to hear.
